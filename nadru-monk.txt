     'Halo of SandSand: Yet another druid AC buff. This one is deflection, though, so it stacks with Barkskin and armor.',

     'Girallon\'s BlessingSC: This spell gives the creature touched an extra set of arms for 10/minutes per level, which can be quite handy if your wildshape form could use some arms to manipulate objects.  There are probably better ways to mete out damage, but solid choice if you think your shark form may need to open a door, chest, etc.',

     'Arctic HazeFrost) and HaboobSand: Damaging and opaque fog. Useful as battlefield control. TremorSC: can be used similarly, but it doesn\'t damage and doesn\'t block line of sight.',
     'Attune FormSC: Immunity from planar effects for caster level/3 characters. A handy spell for high levels, and much more useful than the lower-level Avoid Planar EffectsSC: due to the longer duration.',
     'Bite of the WerewolfSC: Again, a variety of nifty stat buffs and a spare bite attack.',

     'ForestfoldSC: +10 on Hide and Move Silently checks in a natural environment of your choice.',
     'Giant\'s WrathSC: An interesting alternative to Call Lightning. At early levels, the lack of a need for an attack roll, the lack of DR issues, and the greater number of uses per cast makes Call Lightning the better choice. At higher levels, though, the high strength of Wild Shape forms, the caster-level based damage bonus, and the lack of SR on Giant\'s Wrath helps it catch up.',
     'Greater Magic Fang: Handy self-buff and good to share with your Animal Companion.',
     'Junglerazor[sup]SC: Does 1d10/level (up to 10) in a 120ft line. Because it\'s target specific, shoot through your friends to damage only plants, plant critters, vermin, fey and animals.',
     'Poison: Con damage is always handy, and the DC scales upward as you increase in level. A much-overlooked spell.',
     'Primal FormSC: This spell isn\'t overwhelmingly powerful, but it\'s a versatile self-buff. Flight and swim speed are easy to get with Wild Shape, but this spell is available before plentiful Wild Shape uses, and you can choose on the fly among a melee buff, a defensive buff, or a source of flight.',
     'Protection From Energy: A versatile, effective defensive buff. You\'ll rarely regret prepping it.',
     'Remove Disease: Not something you\'re going to prep every day, but handy when you need it.',
     'SpiderskinSC: Barkskin, plus a save bonus against poison and a Hide bonus. Use it on the party sneak, or when you\'re fighting monstrous vermin or Yuan-Ti.',
     'SpikesSC: Improved Brambles. Higher attack, better threat level; what\'s not to like?',
     'SpritjawsSC: I love this spell, and it\'s one of a druid\'s few good force spells. Throw this spell out there and it\'s a combination of Spiritual Weapon and Telekinetic Grapple. It damages and confounds enemies, doing an especially good job of pinning down spellcasters and incorporeal foes.',
     'Swift Lion\'s ChargeMiniHB/Lion\'s ChargeSC: Pouncing is very handy, but this spell can start to eat up spell slots pretty quickly. A similar, overpowered spell named Lion\'s Charge is in Savage Species, and, while it isn\'t swift, it gives the Pounce ability for a duration.',
     'ThornskinSC: Good as a wildshape buff, especially for grapplers, since even trying to escape hurts your enemy.',
     'VenomfireSK: For level/hours, +d6/level damage with no cap added as an additional effect to a poisonous natural attack.',
     'Vigor and Mass Lesser VigorSC: Both can be better than Cure Moderate Wounds at low levels, but only outside of combat. It works when you can\'t summon Unicorns yet and you don\'t have that handy wand of Cure Light Wounds. Doesn\'t work with Extend Spell (see CD FAQ), but Mass Lesser Vigor does work with Persistent Spell.',

     '',
     'Arc of LightningSC: A decent no-SR spell, with damage competitive with that of a wizard or psion. It\'s a conjuration spell, so, that Spell Focus: Conjuration feat you had to pick for Augment Summoning might be useful.',
     'Aspect of the WerebeastRoE: Nothing about this Shifter-only self-buff says it only works when you\'re in a humanoid form. Add +4 to two different attributes, and add Improved Grab, Pounce, or wolf-like Trip to whatever form you\'re in.',
     'Bite of the WereboarSC: Useful stat buffs, a spare bite attack, and one of the better AC buffs around.',
     'Blast of SandSand: Cone of Cold lite (cone, d6/level, max 10d6), only without the energy type. No SR!',
     'Boreal WindFrost: Does decent cold damage, has a fairly big AoE, blows enemies away, disperses fogs and swarms, and keeps going for multiple turns without concentration. Compares favorably even to Flame Strike.',
     'Claws of the SavageBoVD: Got claws? This gives you a +2 enhancement bonus on them, and also gives increases your claw damage as if you were two sizes larger. It is an Evil-typed spell, though.',
     'Giant Vermin',
     'Hibernal HealingFrost: Self-only Heal...as long as you\'re in a frostfell area, anyway.',
     'Last BreathSC: In Complete Divine, this is druidic Revivify, but with a caster-damaging side effect. In Spell Compendium, this is a no-level-loss Reincarnate that must be cast immediately. Both are useful as an emergency option.',
     'Sheltered VitalitySC: Immunity to ability damage or drain is situational, but very powerful when you need it. Cast this before fighting yuan-ti, giant vermin, undead, or anything else with a nasty ability damage or poison attack. The immunity to fatigue can also be handy for the party barbarian.',
     'Vortex of TeethSC: A spell that does force damage, and can tear apart anything that can\'tget away. This makes a mess of anyone caught in Entangle.',
     'Wall of SaltSand: Not quite Wall of Stone, but effective for battlefield control and deterring pursuit.',
     'Wind at BackSC: It lets you double the party\'s overland speed, lasts 12 hours and can let you speed up multiple beasts of burden, as well.',
     'Air Walk: Subject treads on air as if solid (climb at 45-degree angle).',

     'Phantom StagSC: Conjure a very fast mount that it gains a lot of useful additional effects based on caster-level, so that even though its only level 5 its well, it\'s worth preparing at higher level still, since it, for example, can make you ethereal (as the 9th level cleric sor/wiz spell).',
     'Rejuvenation CoccoonSC: A decent out-of-combat Heal alternative.',
     'Choking SandsSand: Miasma, only less so. Alternately, nonpsionic Crisis of Breath. Good for shutting down a caster for a turn.',
     'Cloak of the SeaSC: When you\'re underwater, it\'s Water Breathing, Freedom of Movement, and Blur, all in one neat little (long-duration!) package. A must-have for any underwater adventures.',
     'BlizzardFrost: Instant battle ender. Great for buying some time to parley or obscuring your plans. Huge area of effect.',
     'Call AvalancheFrost While it doesn\'t cause overwhelming damage (only 8d6), it can bury many opponents in its huge area (size of creatures you can bury scales up as well). It only works outdoors, but it does damage and potential immobilization at long range. For a good trick trick, follow it up with Blood Snow and all the poor buried victims start taking CON drain while trying futilely to escape.',

  '6 x 1+0': 
   [ 'Antilife Shell: Exceedingly powerful defensive spell. Anything living without SR just can\'t touch you.',

     'Find the Path: Never, ever, EVER be lost.',
     'Fire Seeds: Excellent trap spell when used to make holly berry bombs. Couple it with some sort of fire resistance or immunity and you have a killer emanation-from-yourself nuke.',
     'MummifySand: Save or die. Plus, it\'s not death magic.',
     'Spellstaff: One extra spell slot, of whatever level you can cast. Clerics with Miracle have no reason not to duplicate this very handy spell.',
     'Superior ResistanceSC: +6 on all saves, all day. Its utility is obvious. (Spell Compendium upped the level, but also the duration. It\'s still worth it, unlike the pounding Major Resistance took.)',
     '',
     'Bite of the WerebearSC: Bite of the Weretiger only moreso.',
     'Chasing PerfectionPHB2: Handy as a self-buff, since it\'s hard to use magic items in Wild Shape. Won\'t be terribly useful to the rest of the party at level 13, though.',
     'DrownSC: Save or dying (0 hp). Handy for capturing enemies alive. Not death magic, but obviously doesn\'t work on non-living creatures, water-breathers, or creatures with no lungs. This has replaced the repeatedly-nerfed MiasmaSC.',
     'Energy ImmunitySC: Powerful, of a bit situational, defensive buff. Has a long enough duration to have it on all the time.',
     'Fires of PuritySC: A hefty melee damage buff, plus Flame Shield lite. Note that, while this spell is three levels higher than Venomfire and only adds one point per caster level instead of d6, it\'s still a good spell. That\'s how silly Venomfire is.',
     'Tortoise ShellSC: Basically, Greater Barkskin. Not as good as Greater Luminous Armor, but is natural armor instead of armor.',
     'Liveoak: Handy if you need a Treant to guard your camp or home. The casting time and casting limitations limit its general usefulness, though.',
     'Greater Dispel Magic: Unlike mages and clerics, druids very rarely lose caster levels, so this is often a worthwhile spell to prep.',
     'Greater Scrying: Scrying without the long casting time and relatively short duration; the minor spells you can cast through the sensor aren\'t that useful.' ] }

items [ '3x Wilding Clasp: Appearing as a 3-inch-long gold chain, this item works only when attached to an amulet, vest, or similar item. The clasp prevents both itself and the attached item from melding into the wearer’s new form when transforming magic (such as polymorph self or wild shape) is used. The item is still worn in the same manner it previously was and remains available for use in the new form. For example, a druid with a wilding clasp attached to her periapt of Wisdom could use wild shape to become a wolf, but the periapt and the wilding clasp would remain in their normal forms, fully functional.  Some forms may be harmful to certain items; for in- stance, it would be unwise to take the form of a fire ele- mental while retaining a functional necklace of fireballs.  Casler Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, poly- morph self or wild shape ability; Market Price: 4,000 gp; Weight:',
